## ðŸ§  Understanding Ad Hoc Command Structure

- `all`: Refers to all hosts listed in the inventory.
- `cisco`: Refers to the host group named `[cisco]` in the inventory file.
- `-i`: Specifies the path to the inventory file.
- `-m`: Specifies the module to run (e.g., `ping`, `ios_facts`).
- `-a`: Specifies the arguments to pass to the module (e.g., command input, configuration lines).

These components work together to let you target specific devices and run specific Ansible modules without needing a full playbook.
